# Quiz_App
A flutter application that allows users to test their knowledge through quizzes made for specific topics.

## Setup
The application consists of a front-end and backend, both implemented using the dart programming language. The backend acts as an API that recieves requests from the front-end when a user is looking for a quiz to attempt. The backend will retrieve data stored in a MongoDB database, stored on the cloud via MongoDB Atlas.
